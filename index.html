					<h3>Farm 2 iOS</h3>
					<p>
					This game was my first iOS project I did in High School. I was stunned with the beauty of Objective-C, Cocoa and the strong community.<br>
						The game is available to download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/farm-2-free/id506010507?mt=8">here</a>.

					<h2>Karate Panda</h2>
					<p>
						Karate Panda is a PC game for kids I developed when I was 16. Day by day, for over a year, combining my little knowledge of C++ and OpenGL, I finished the it.
The game was later published by 'Play' and sold in a few Europe countries.

					<h3>Base CRM</h3>
					<p>
					I had a great privilege to work on the early versions of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/base-crm-and-sales-tracking/id488534576?mt=8">Base iOS app</a>. It helps companies to manage their contacts, deals and so much more.

					<h2>Global Game Jam</h2>
					<p>
						Athletes goes to gym and hackers goes to hackathons.<br>
						Pushing own limits and coding under high time pressure is extremely important. That's why I attended many hackathons. One of them was Global Game Jam during which I made an iOS game in less than 48h.
