					<h3>Farm 2 iOS</h3>
					<p>
						This is the moment when I meet iOS for the first time. I've got a task to port PC game to iOS and as the project was going on, I was falling in love in Obj-C, Cocoa and entire community. <br>
						The game was published and is available <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/farm-2-free/id506010507?mt=8">here</a>.

					<h3>Base CRM</h3>
					<p>
					I had a great privilege to work on the early versions of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/base-crm-and-sales-tracking/id488534576?mt=8">Base iOS app</a>. It helps companies to manage their contacts, deals and so much more. The team has been strongly focused on delivering the best experience in the Post-PC era by completely rethinking how enterprise software should work.
