				<h1 id="subheader">THINGS I DO</h2>
				<p id="aboutHeader">
				I've always been taught to act. Stagnation is the greatest enemy of innovation and dreams.<br>
				Building games, developing Post-PC business software, attending hackathons and conferences, traveling - those are the things I love to do. <br>
				<br>
				Here are some of the results.

			<div class="firstProjectBlock projectSection">
				<div class="descriptionSection">
					<h3>Farm 2 iOS</h3>
					<p>
						This is the moment when I meet iOS for the first time. I've got a task to port PC game to iOS and as the project was going on, I was falling in love in Obj-C, Cocoa and entire community. The game was published and is available here.
					</p>

				<div class="descriptionSection">
					<h2>Karate Panda</h2>
					<p>
						One of my first project was a PC game for kids - Karate Panda. That's the point where everything has started - I've 	learnt basics of programming and managed to successfully publish the game. 
						</p>

			<!-- 	Base	 -->
			<div class="thirdProjectBlock projectSection">
				<div class="descriptionSection">
					<h3>Base CRM</h3>
					<p>
					I had a great privilege to work on the early versions of the Base iOS app - a Post-PC CRM.
					<br> The team has been strongly focused on delivering the best experience in the Post-PC era by completely rethinking how enterprise software should work.

			<!-- 	KrakJam		-->
			<div class="fourthProjectBlock projectSection">
				<div class="descriptionSection">
					<h3>Global Game Jam</h3>
					<p>
						Sometimes it's not so important what you're building, but how fast you can do it. Under time pressure, great innovation is freed. During 'Global Game Jam', together with friends, we've created working game in less than 48 hours.<br>
						 Hackathons are just like a gym - it's the best place to keep your mind innovating.
					</p>

			<!-- 	Cocoa Heads		-->
			<div class="fifthProjectBlock projectSection">
				<div class="descriptionSection">
					<h3>CocoaHeads</h3>
					<p>
						<i>"Those who know, do. Those who understand, teach".</i><br>
						<br>
						 Sharing knowledge is a crucial part of our community. That's why I'm a co-organizer of first CocoaHeads meetup in Poland which gathers iOS and OSX passionates. There's no better way to learn than teaching.

			<!-- 	WWDC	 -->
			<div class="sixthProjectBlock projectSection">
				<div class="descriptionSection">
					<h3>WWDC</h3>
					<p>
						There is no such place as WWDC. Thousands of passionate people brought together always results in thrilling experience. 
						<br>I've attended WWDC in 2012 and 2013 (as Apple's Student Scholarship winner).
